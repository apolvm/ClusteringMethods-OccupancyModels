#Clustering Methods and Occupancy Models

#Abstract
Community science projects are a good
resourceful way to access huge amounts of
data. Since it has low barriers to contribute,
it is voluntary, and crowdsource data from
different locations. However, one of the
disadvantages that are encountered with
community science data is imperfect
detection; the phenomenon in which
observers do not detect all individuals and/or
species present during a survey [1].
Occupancy models are used to account for
imperfect detection of organisms in surveys
and to determine the probability of the true
presence or absence of a species at a site [2].
In this paper, different clustering methods
are explored to find a method that helps with
obtaining better detection and occupancy
estimates.
